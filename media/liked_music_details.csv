Lyrics
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin,
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well I remember, I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget,
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up,
No you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show
But the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

LYRICS
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

Lyrics:

It’s another day, wanna get away from here
There’s a plane out on a runway,
Gonna run away from here.
Cuz the rain is so terribly dull,
And it bores me,
Misery adores me.
I wanna break out and get away.
I wanna just try and live for me.
Cuz if we don’t try then we won’t believe that we could’ve had it.
I wanna let go and fall for you,
And when it gets rough be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about,
Are you ready?
I’m done with small town politics,
I need to make my way to where the action is.
I’m done with it, so the question is - are you coming with?
Cuz’ baby if you like I’ll take you there,
Imagine all the places we could go to disappear.
Or we can turn the light off and go back to bed,
Stare at the stars on your ceiling and pretend that we’re somewhere else.
We don’t need a God to take a leap of faith;
Listen when I say,
That if we don’t try, then we won’t believe.

Lyrics
I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around and she was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry

Well, you couldn't be that girl I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
No, I don't know her anymore

There's nothing where we used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins and now
I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel, I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn

You're a little late
I'm already torn

Torn

There's nothing where we used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
And that's what is goin' on
Nothin's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel, I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late
I'm already torn
Torn

Alt text video description: The video shows the band performing inside a living room. The room is made out to seem like a production set, as if they’re actively filming the music video while we’re watching. A hair/ makeup artist comes in and fixes their hair, a director walks in with a clapboard, a guitar tech comes in to switch out guitars, a wardrobe person comes in to fix their clothes, etc. The living room set is slowly cleaned up and taken away, leaving the band standing in a production studio.

The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on

Nothing's right, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn
Oh
(Oh yeah, a little)
(Oh yeah, a little)
(Oh yeah, a little)",2024-06-27T22:51:36Z,VV1XWJN3nJo

Lyrics:
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
When sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

The first single release from the new Alphaville album ‘Eternally Yours’, which Marian Gold has recorded with arrangers Max Knoth and Christian Lohr and the Babelsberg Film Orchestra, is available now!
 
The orchestral version of ‘Big in Japan’ reaches us forty years almost to the day since the band was formed, and it has such a natural, warm, even familiar ensemble sound that listening to it, you’re surprised there have never been symphonic arrangements of Alphaville songs before.
 
Marian Gold: “Arranging ‘Big in Japan’ has brought out the essence of it more clearly; the song’s been stripped clean, released, set free. Its true nature has come to light. The 23 songs on ‘Eternally Yours’ – which includes ‘Big in Japan’ of course – really do sound to me as if this was actually the first Alphaville album – except that forty years ago, it wasn’t released.  After all, we didn’t have access to an orchestra in those days, we ‘only’ had synthesizers and rhythm machines.”
 
The song, written in a demo version back in the Seventies, tells the fictional story of a couple who try in vain to break free from heroin on the drug scene at Bahnhof Zoo in Berlin. Everything would have been possible, if only they were ‘Big in Japan’.
 
When it came out in 1984, ‘Big in Japan’ was not only Alphaville’s first No. 1 hit – the song headed the Media Control charts for a total of 23 weeks, making it the year’s mosts successful single in Germany. It’s scored triple gold to date.
(Max Dax)

Lyrics:
And if you want to leave
Then I’m playing defense
why you acting different
Round these people
acting like you’re one of them
 
Say you want to breathe
But you’re the one with hands around my neck
I’m trynna let you go but I’m obsessed
I’m impulsive
 
You keep tearing me apart but I’m out here falling
And I’ll let you drive my cars but you crashed them all in
But I’d rather die
see you with another guy
Even though you lie
Leaving you is suicide
 
You bring terror to my heart, ill still let you crawl in
And I love you for your scars, but I hate these problems
But I’d rather die
See you with another guy
Even though you lie
Leaving you is suicide
 
If you wanna go
Then pack up all your shit and leave out that door
It hurts me even more to know that you’re still here waiting on me (waiting on me)
 
I’m not heard
I needed you to love me first
I come back to you to make it work
A thousand times I’ve told you and I’ll tell you again (tell you again)
 
You keep tearing me apart but I’m out here falling
And I’ll let you drive my cars but you crashed them all in
But I’d rather die
see you with another guy
Even though you lie
Leaving you is suicide
 
You bring terror to my heart, ill still let you crawl in
And I love you for your scars, but I hate these problems
But I’d rather die
See you with another guy
Even though you lie
Leaving you is suicide
 
Suicide
Suicide
Leaving you is suicide
I need you to love me but instead you left me here to die
Suicide
Switch the sides
Come back to me every night and every night you ruin mine
 
Take me out of my
Misery
Let me down from my
Hopes and dreams
Take me out of my


Misery
Let me down from my
Hopes and dreams
 
You keep tearing me apart but I’m out here falling
And I’ll let you drive my cars but you crashed them all in
But I’d rather die
see you with another guy
Even though you lie
Leaving you is suicide
 
You bring terror to my heart, ill still let you crawl in
And I love you for your scars, but I hate these problems
But I’d rather die
See you with another guy
Even though you lie
Leaving you is suicide
 
Suicide
Suicide
Leaving you is suicide
I need you to love me but instead you left me here to die
Suicide
Switch the sides
Come back to me every night and every night you ruin mine
So who am I

About the album 'Eternally Yours':
Alphaville, Germany’s biggest synth-pop export and creator of the legendary 80s anthems “Big in Japan”, “Sounds like a Melody” and “Forever Young”, has decided to go symphonic. The band is doing things on the grand scale and catapulting the band’s 40 years of greatest hits out of the orbit of synthesizers and rhythm machines into the world of the human sound machine, the symphony orchestra. “Eternally Yours” is more, much more, than a mere translation of the songs into the sound spectrum of a great orchestra. What it amounts to, rather, is a symbiosis of Marian Gold’s unique vocal capacities, the original Alphaville sound and the majestic power and rich timbres of the concert-hall-sized German Film Orchestra of Babelsberg.
“Eternally Yours” is about the everlasting theme of endurance and evanescence. The lyrics of songs from the past four decades were written predominantly by Gold himself. One central theme for Alphaville and Gold has always been the dream: “We really get around quite a lot, we’ve played almost everywhere, in our heads and out of our heads. All that goes into our music, into the idea of what Alphaville could be. It is like a never-ending dream. Those who hear our music hear fragments of this dream.” The title-track, specifically written for this event comes across like an amorous farewell letter. “I didn't write a single line of my own for this song. All the words and all the ideas come from Shakespeare's Sonnetts. All I did was recompile and minimally adjust them, so as to make them more singable for me.” 
“All 23 musical pieces on this album have been essentially clarified by their arrangement, they’re stripped clean, released, set free. Their true nature has been revealed.” Gold and his two arrangers Max Knoth and Christian Lohr have given this album the sonic ambience that matches the musical content of its songs. The songs don’t sound overblown, either, they’re not pushed beyond their limits – on the contrary, the album has such natural, warm, even familiar tones that listening to it, you wonder why there haven’t been more symphonic arrangements of Alphaville songs in the past. Gold goes so far as to say: “When I hear it, ‘Eternally Yours’ really does sound as if it were actually the first Alphaville album – except that for forty years, it lay unreleased. We simply didn’t have access to an orchestra in those days.”
The album “Eternally Yours” by Alphaville with the German Film Orchestra Babelsberg was released with @NeueMeister on September 23, 2022.  

Marian Gold about ""Forever Young"": 
“The video for ‘Forever Young’ was shot somewhere in the outskirts of London inside an abandoned building that was once used as a lunatic asylum. It was planned the video would take place in the setting of a bunker with a couple of survivors from World War III. I remember me walking through the rotten corridors of the location during a shooting break. In one of the deserted wings, the floors were covered with paper-sheets containing medical reports of former patients. I couldn’t help but reading some of them and it was a weird sensation being confronted with these intimate tragedies while we were performing the end of the world next door. And then a thought hit me: Maybe I’m just imagining all this. What if the next document bears my name? What if I’m not a pop star? What if I’m just mad…?”

“You can’t write a song like ‘Forever Young’ on purpose. You can only write it accidentally.”

LYRICS: 
I saw you movin on the dance floor
I caught you looking over at me and friends 
Got my attention now I want more 
I think we both know how this night’s gonna end 
The way that you move your hips to the rhythm of the beat 
You got me so nervous think I need another drink 
But then you grabbed my hand said baby come with me 
This wasn’t a part of the plan, no

But you look
You look so perfect dancing next to me
I wish the sun would look the other way 

Cuz I never want this night to end 
Baby we could turn back time
Do it all over again 
Tomorrow we can press rewind 
We’re staying at the Lotus inn
Baby we could turn back time
Do it all over again 
Tomorrow we can press rewind 
I never want this night to end 

Played you this song up on the stereo
You played it over and over again
Before it even hit the radio 
Now they spin it over and over again
We’ve had a few good nights and a couple of bad ones 
A few bad fights but I’m glad that they happened
And At the end of the night I can honestly say 
I’d do it over and over and over again 

But you look
You look so perfect dancing next to me
I wish the sun would look the other way

Cause I never want this night to end
Baby we could turn back time
Do it all over again 
Tomorrow we could press rewind
We’re staying at the Lotus Inn
Baby we can turn back time 
Do it all over again tomorrow we can press rewind 
I never want this night to end

Baby we can turn back time
Do it all over again 
Tomorrow we could press rewind
We’re staying at the Lotus Inn
Baby we could turn back time
Do it all over again 
Tomorrow we could press rewind 
I never want this night to end

Shaggy - It Wasn't Me (Video),"Shaggy performing It Wasn't Me

Lyrics:
Yo, man
(Yo)
Open up, man
(Yeah, what do you want, man?)
My girl just caught me
(You let her catch you?)
I don't know how I let this happen
(With who?)
The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
(Say it wasn't you)
Alright
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt n**ed
B***ing on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
How you can grant your woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Let's review the situation that you're caught up inna
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word when she say
And if she claims ah you tell her baby no way
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the screams get louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt n**ed
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her
From what she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me
Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident, you betta know fe mask
Quick 'pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know, you betta run fast
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the screams get louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt n**ed
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listening to your reasoning
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt n**ed
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

►Download the sheet music here: http://bit.ly/2mZjSne

Let’s face it - OneRepublic is a great band. If you don’t know who they are, you definitely know their songs. It was this band that inspired Zack to start studying pop music. All of us are classically trained, and we grew up listening to all kinds of music. But classical music took the majority of our time. It wasn’t until we were older that we started to study pop music and what makes it popular. OneRepublic’s songs are all so catchy, and Counting Stars especially struck a chord 😏 with us. It was our first video that we filmed outside of Arizona. We were in New York for a performance, so we thought, ""We have to take advantage of this and shoot a video in New York City!"" It was a really fun day going around that great city. Hope you guys enjoy, and thanks for listening!

LYRICS
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my faces flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I, feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I, feel something so wrong
But doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is a four letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I, feel something so wrong
But doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

Take that money and watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

Take that money and watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

Take that money and watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

Take that money and watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

Lyrics : 

Walking tipsy, briskly from the scene of the crash,
It felt too good how high you stood it would not last
You broke a few hearts .. a couple promises too –
Left arm, Left leg, your Eye socket's blue, oh
Will the throbbing in your head ever stop?
The taste of blood encased in mud -
it aches on the topYou'll take a 7... and a SEVEN once more
Take it down, await the town, and break on the floor

You won't make it. Take it
You cannot sleep
Living day to day, it shakes you – they struck you deep
You're a blatant stranger changer until you're deceased
This is yours now, your pain to keep

Grab a cutlass, a rope, and frame from that shrine
Don't forget the angel sent from lord divine
Able men won't come, so it's just me and you
We need to show them why they're out,
They only knew
Table any thought because it's time to shine
Any disappointment come and meet me this time
In the wrong? Please... just take in that view
Can it for your sisters and your mothers too

You won't make it. Take it
You cannot sleep
Living day to day, it shakes you – they struck you deep
You're a blatant stranger changer until you're deceased
This is yours now, your pain to keep

Drift out in the ocean - Goshen. Take the leap
Shadows only haunt the children of the discreet
Sway until the day it makes it, they will fall right
Bright away the chains and stakes and fall down for the night

Lyrics
If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day 'til eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure, and then
Again, I would spend them with you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty
Except for the memory of how they were answered by you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

In memory of guitarist HILTON VALENTINE (1943 - 2021) and bass player CHAS CHANDLER (1938 - 1996)

✿ܓ✿ܓ✿ܓ✿ܓ✿ܓ✿ܓ

January 29, 2021 - Very sad news that legendary guitarist with The Animals HILTON VALENTINE has died. What can you say about this man who gave us so much in the world of rock n roll... it's hard to summarise but he was a beautiful, great, influential guitarist who blessed us with his talent and flair with so many unforgettable and legendary performances. Chuck Berry (!) once described Hilton Valentine as ""a wildly exciting instrumentalist"", absolutely yes! there was so much more to Hilton than House of the Rising Sun, please check out Hilton's stormin' performances on album tracks and live performances and you would soon hear why Chuck Berry would acknowledge Hilton in this way. Let it Rock! Hilton, we loved and admired you and forevermore thank you for all your innovative contributions to rock n roll and for your presence. Rest in Peace and Love Forever! (From your loving fan, Magusmagic).

ERIC BURDON has paid tribute to his fellow band member - 'The opening opus of Rising Sun will never sound the same!... You didn’t just play it, you lived it! Heartbroken by the sudden news of Hilton’s passing. We had great times together, Geordie lad. From the North Shields to the entire world...Rock In Peace'.

LYRICS

I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around
I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast
I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree

Sing!
Dap-dadada-dadpm-didap-da
Dadada-dadpm-didap-da
Dap-didili-da

I'm sittin' here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out takin' a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder

Isolation is not good for me
Isolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree

I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
And I wonder, wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree

Lyrics:
For a while there it was rough 
But lately I’ve been doing better 
Than the last four cold Decembers
I recall 
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She’ll come and stay the night
I think I might have it all 
And I thank god everyday 
For the girl he sent my way 
But I know the things he gives me
He can take away 
And I hold you every night
That’s a feeling I wanna get used to 
But there’s no man as terrified 
As the man who stands to lose you 
Oh I hope I don’t lose you
Mmm
Please 
Stay
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t 
Take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please stay 
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please don’t take,
I found my mind I’m feeling sane
It’s been a while but I’m finding my faith
If everything’s good and it’s great why do I sit and wait till it’s gone
Oh I’ll tell ya I know I’ve got enough
I got peace,
And I got love,
But I’m up at night thinking I just might lose it all
Please stay 
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please stay
I want you I need you oh god
I need
These beautiful things that I’ve got

LYRICS
Father:
It’s not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You’re still young, that’s your fault
There’s so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old but I’m happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it’s not easy
To be calm when you’ve found
Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you’ve got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

Son:
How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again?
It’s always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen
Now there’s a way, and I know that I have to go
Away, I know I have to go

Father:
It’s not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You’re still young, that’s your fault
There’s so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old but I’m happy

Son:
Away, away, away, I know
I have to make this decision alone – no

Son:
All the times that I’ve cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
It’s hard, but it’s harder to ignore it
If they were right I’d agree, but it’s them you know not me
Now there’s a way and I know that I have to go
Away, I know, I have to go

Father:
Stay, stay, stay, why must you go and
Make this decision alone? No

I want more berries

It’s so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in
Breathe me out

I’m just thinking out loud
I don’t know if I could ever go without

Strawberries
On a summer evening
Baby, you’re the end of June
I want your belly
And that summer feeling
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in
Breathe me out

Watermelon sugar high
 
I just wanna taste it
I just wanna taste it

Tastes like strawberries

LYRICS

Do you wanna be my girlfriend?
I’ll take you to a movie that we’ve already seen 
Or sit at home and watch reruns
There’s no other place I’d wanna be
 
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?
 
Do you wanna be my boyfriend?
We’ll walk the cemetery and I’ll kiss you again 
And make our dead friends blush 
We’ll be getting married right there on the scene
Do you want to be my best friend? 
You can drive me crazy all over again 
And I’ll bore you to death
Doesn’t matter when we are in love 
 
Do you wanna be my boyfriend? 
 
You’re not just any type of girl
My one true love and you’re my world 
 
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?
Do you wanna be my boyfriend? 
Do you wanna be my
 
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?
Do you wanna be my boyfriend? 
Do you wanna be my

Well, you can tell by the way I do your mom
I'm a mother's man, I keep her calm
Moaning loud, your mom is warm
I've been doin your mom before you were born

And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
But you will never understand
The way that booty fills my hand

I’m not like the others im just here to do your mother
Yeah I’m doin your mom, doin your mom
Feel the bedroom quakin and your momma starts a shakin'
Yeah im doin your mom, doin your mom

Lyrics:
I just found the keys to a city
The beats are big and the lights are pretty
So why can't we get to the busy where the dreams are in the sky
You got me high, you got me high, on wonders and why
You got me high, you got me high, I think I might die
I'm face to face with a mirror
I've never felt so one with another
So why can't it all be clearer, don't you see the sign
It's not fair, let me put my fingers through your hair
It's not fair (it's not fair), I'm not full without you there, but there you are
Fa la la laa laa laa, wish upon a star
Fa la la laa laa laa, wish we could go far
I just close my eyes and there you are (and there you are)
I just close my eyes and there you are",2024-02-03T03:23:40Z,5tOAZkrkuVA

Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams?
Who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around
When you break?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?
You know you can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?
Oh-oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
(Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?)
Grey clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above
(Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?)

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before? Oh
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
If you close your eyes

Lyrics:
Baby, I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why

If I was ya man (baby, you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby, you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you

Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control, baby you know

If I was ya man (baby, you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby, you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Ooh, baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me

You deserve better, girl (you know you deserve better)
We should be together, girl (baby)
With me and you it's whatever, girl, hey!
So can we make this thing ours?
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you
Let me love you, that's all you need, baby

""I Won't Back Down"" 

Well, I won't back down
No I won't back down
You could stand me up at the gates of Hell
But I won't back down
No I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down
Hey baby
There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)
Hey I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
Well, I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down
Hey baby
There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)
Hey I will stand my ground (I won't back down)
And I won't back down
Hey baby
There ain't no easy way out (I won't back down)
Hey I won't back down

Lyrics:

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
So jet-lagged

What time is it where you are?
I miss you more than anything
And back at home you feel so far
Waiting for the phone to ring
It's getting lonely living upside down
I don't even wanna be in this town
Tryna figure out the time zone's making me crazy

You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss you so bad, and my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged

What time is it where you are?
Five more days and I'll be home
I keep your picture in my car
I hate the thought of you alone
I've been keeping busy all the time
Just to try to keep you off my mind
Tryna figure out the time zone's making me crazy

You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss you so bad, and my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged

I miss you so bad (I miss you so bad)
I miss you so bad (I miss you so bad)
I miss you so bad (I wanna share your horizon)
I miss you so bad, and see the same sun rising
I miss you so bad and turn the hour hand back to when you were holding me

You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss when you say good morning, but it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up, to your sunset
And it's drivin' me mad, I miss you so bad
And my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged

'Perpetuum Mobile' Penguin Cafe Orchestra PIANO SOLO arr. P. Barton,"Related PIANO LESSON on ""Perpetuum Mobile"" by Simon Jeffes/Penguin Cafe Orchestra for solo piano http://youtu.be/JwsD33bz5o4?list=UU-4HMv1j00QTebcFg4mV2DQ

Note about the pedaling this recording: I jotted down this solo piano arrangement with the 4th harmonic pedal in mind but it can be played with the sustain pedal, although the effects are different.

The original version for Penguin Cafe Orchestra has long chords played by stringed instruments.  The sostenuto part of the 4th harmonic pedal can hold chords on piano and when released to resonance half position the perpetuum mobile part can be played clearly independently on top of these chords without the mixing we get with the sustain pedal.",2024-01-28T21:38:18Z,sz-WK3q3mc0

Lyrics
Things haven’t been quite the same,
There’s a haze on the horizon babe, 
It’s only been a couple of days and I miss you, 
Mmm yeah,
When nothing really goes to plan,
You stub your toe, or break your camera, 
I’ll do everything I can to help you through,
 
If you’re feeling down,
I just wanna make you happier baby, 
Wish I was around, 
I just wanna make you happier baby, 
 
We’ve been doing all this late night talking,
About anything you want until the morning,
Now you’re in my life,
I can’t get you off my mind, 
 
I’ve never been a fan of change,
But I’d follow you to any place,
If it’s Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I’m coming too, 
 
If you’re feeling down,
I just want to make you happier baby, 
Wish I was around,
I just wanna make you happier baby, 
 
We’ve been doing all this late night talking,
About anything you want until the morning,
Now you’re in my life,
I can’t get you off my mind,
 
Can’t get you off my mind,
Can’t get you off my mind,
I won’t even try,
To get you off my mind,
Get you off my mind,
 
We’ve been doing all this late night talking,
About anything you want until the morning,
Now you’re in my life,
I can’t get you off my mind,
 
Can’t get you off my mind,
(All this late night talking),
Can’t get you off my mind,
(All this late night talking),
I won’t even try,
(All this late night talking),
Can’t get you off my,
(All this late night talking),

Lyrics: 
How many scars have you got?
How many tears have you dropped?
Suffering
Do you like who you are?
Do you like who you are?
I’m struggling to be the man that you want
But I’ll give what I got
Promises
I really like who you are
I really like who you are
But I’m a useless, doofus, I’m always confused
And you get no improvement whatsoever
Her friends say she can do better, so
Before I surrender
At least can I get a little something to remember before we say goodbye?
“Don’t be so hollow, don’t be so dead inside
Those tees I borrowed, you’ll never get ‘em back, goodbye”
I never know when to stop
I’m trying to think, can you not?
Punishing
I’m alright if you are
I’m alright if you are
I gotta say that she’s the best that I got
Thinks I’m a freak but it’s hot
Lucky me
I think she might take it off
I think she might take it off
I’m a dumbstruck, dumbfuck, head like a dumb truck
Oh, and the more you talk the less I listen
Can’t help thinking what you’re missing, so
Before I surrender
At least can I get a little something to remember before we say goodbye?
“Don’t be so hollow, don’t be so dead inside
Those tees I borrowed, you’ll never get ‘em back, goodbye”

Do you like who you are?
I really like who you are
I’m alright if you are
I think she might call it off
Before I surrender
At least can I get a little something to remember
Before I surrender
At least can I get a little something to remember before we say goodbye?
“Don’t be so hollow, don’t be so dead inside
Those tees I borrowed, you’ll never get ‘em back, goodbye”

Lyrics:
Dirt on your heels, you’ve made a mess
Down by the carpark, high off your head
Honey don’t worry, nobody’s angry at any of this
Darling be patient, stare into the vacancy, take a deep breath

It’s like when you’re tired, you’re someone else
Don’t speak for some time to find those words inside yourself
Honey don’t worry, I’ll do your laundry, covered in dirt
Darling be patient, it’s easy to break beneath the weight of the earth
And I’ll say

Always, I’ll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I’ll be the light that you can’t make
I’ll be your eyes you be my face
Cuz darling I get scared for you and I’m not busy anyway

Today you looked older than me
Hair in your face it fills the space between your teeth
All of your falling, does it get exhausting? Have you gotten sleep?
You said you were sorry, that you hadn’t called me in over a week 
And I said 

Always, I’ll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I’ll be the light that you can’t make
I’ll be your eyes you be my face
Cuz darling I get scared for you and I’m not busy anyway

I hope, I ain’t the last of what the world left you
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather

Always, I’ll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I’ll be the light that you can’t make
I’ll be your eyes you be my face
Cuz darling I get scared for you and I’m not busy anyway",2024-01-23T00:41:29Z,5HzpPl5a9EA

Lyrics:
If it seems like I've been lost
In let's remember
If you think I'm feeling older
And missing my younger days
Oh, then you should have known me much better
'Cause my past is something that never
Got in my way
Oh no

Still I would not be here now
If I never had the hunger
And I'm not ashamed to say
The wild boys were my friends
Oh
'Cause I never felt the desire
'Til their music set me on fire
And then I was saved, yeah
That's why I'm keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith

Lyrics:
You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

LYRICS

When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run run run run run
Staring at the lights they look so pretty
Momma said “son son son son son
You’re gonna grow up, you’re gonna get old
All that glitters don’t turn to gold
But until then just have your fun
Boy, run run run run run”

Yeah, run run run
Run run run

When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay pay pay pay pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last 3, 4, 5 days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy run run run run run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They’ll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run run run 

Yeah, one day well the sky might fall 
Yeah, one day I could lose it all 
So I run until I hit that wall 
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings 
Look to the rising sun and run run run

Run run run

Didn’t get everything that I wanted 
But I got what I need, yeah yeah 
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me 
So take me up high, take me down low 
Where it all ends nobody knows
But until then let’s have some, yeah
Run run run run run 

They tell you that the sky might fall 
They’ll say that you might lose it all 
So I run until I hit that wall 
Yeah I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run run run 

Yeah, one day well the sky might fall 
Yeah, one day I could lose it all 
So I run until I hit that wall 
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings 
Look to the rising sun and run run run

Run run run
Yeah, Run run run

Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun

Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun

Yeah, if I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun, yeah, run run run

Lyrics:

When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things that you're dreaming about
When you open up your heart and the truth comes out

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep",2024-01-20T02:36:20Z,JmGMzyajA2U

Lyrics:

Sometimes I lay
Under the moon
And thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray
Don't take me soon
'Cause I am here for a reason

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around because...

All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There will be no more wars
And our children will play
One day

It's not about
Win or lose
'Cause we all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood-drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging

In this maze you can lose your way (your way)
It might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you, no way (no way)",2024-01-20T02:32:38Z,WRmBChQjZPs

The Alan Parsons Project - Games People Play (Official HD Video),"Official HD Video for ""Games People Play"" by The Alan Parsons Project

`Games People Play' was the second single from the Alan Parsons Project's 5th studio album The Turn Of A Friendly Card and was released in 1980. The song peaked at number 16 in the US charts and has remained one of the APP's most popular singles ever since. Lenny Zakatek was chosen to sing the upbeat song about the dangers of gambling and can be seen in the video alongside APP stalwarts Stuart Elliott on drums, David Paton and Ian Bairnson on guitars. APP founder and songwriter Eric Woolfson (on keyboard) and producer Alan Parsons (at the mixing desk) also appear in the video. The title came from a psychology book of the same name, which Eric's wife Hazel was reading at the time.

Lyrics:

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
Oh

I loved you since I knew ya
I wouldn't talk down to ya
I have to tell you just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up
So put away your make up
Told you once I won't tell you again it's a bad way

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light...

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chrous 1]
It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Verse 2]
Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on Earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Outro]
Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same

Lyrics:


Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be okay

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye


I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye

Lyrics:

Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
The only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

Poets, priests, and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no one's jamming their transmission
Because when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

Lyrics

Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh but I
Need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh when that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door

‘Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Baby,
I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes I've gotta have faith…
Mmm, I gotta have faith
‘Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Cause I gotta have faith
Mmm I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith-a-faith-a-faith
I gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith",2024-01-20T02:07:28Z,6Cs3Pvmmv0E
Double - The Captain Of Her Heart (Official Video),"There‘s a 4K version of the video on http://youtube.com/@KurtMaloo

The Captain Of Her Heart

It was way past midnight
and she still couldn't fall asleep. 
This night the dream was leaving, 
she'd tried so hard to keep
and with the new day's dawning 
she felt it drift away,
not only for a cruise
not only for a day.

Too long ago, too long apart, 
she couldn't wait another day for 
the captain of her heart

As the day came up she made a start, 
she stopped waiting another day for 
the captain of her heart",2024-01-20T02:07:25Z,YX-Ru1XkNZc

Lyrics:

Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in, to fill up your room.
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand.

She's slippy, you're sliding down.
She'll be there when you hit the ground.

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways, oh.

Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain.
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal.
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy!

She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child.

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways, yeah, oh, ah.

Lift my days, light up my nights, oh.

One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held now by this love.
While you could stand there,
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling.

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways.

Move you, spirits move you
Move, spirits 'its move you, oh yeah.
Does it move you?
She moves with it.
Lift my days, and light up my nights, oh.",2024-01-20T02:07:14Z,TxcDTUMLQJI

Revolt against the honor to obey
Overthrow the effigy

Well, burning down the foreman of control
Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, wah hey

When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes
Sing!
Well, violence is an energy, oh ay, oh ay
Well, from here to eternity, oh ay, oh ay
Well, violence is an energy, oh ay, oh ay
Well, silence is the enemy so gimme gimme revolution!
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, wah hey
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, wah hey
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, wah hey
Overthrow the effigy

Burning down the foreman of control
Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul

Lyrics:

And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe, I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well, then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for",2024-01-20T02:05:16Z,HyTpu6BmE88

Lyrics

Ah, ah, ah, ah

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway)
While colour lights up your face
(Let's sway)
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
For fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance)
For fear tonight is all
(Let's sway)
You could look into my eyes
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower


(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song we're playing
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

(Let's dance)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's dance)
(Let's)

Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway)
Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,” Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie’s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

Lyrics
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying

Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

Even try ……I'll always be here by your side
Why, why, why ……I never wanted to say goodbye
Why even try ….I'm always here if you change, change your mind

So you 're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying

Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I even try?

Lyrics:

Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies
We can't hear anything at all
Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why
The secretaries pout and preen like
Cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake
Many miles away, many miles away

Lyrics:

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin’ woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

Here comes Johnny and he’ll tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin’ shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin’ blues

He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin’ woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

And after all the violence and double talk
There’s just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, you do the walk of life

Lyrics
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness, inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Like a rainbow

Show me a smile
And don't be unhappy,
Can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Just show your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Like a rainbow

Such sad eyes
Take courage now
Realize

When this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Just show your true colors
True colors, true colors

There's a shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid just let them show
Your true colors, true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Beautiful, like a rainbow

Show me your colors
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow
Show me your rainbow
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow
That's why I love you
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow
That's why I love you
Show me your colors
Show me your rainbow

Lyrics
Love can make you do things you never dreamed possible...'

I got lost, couldn't find my way
and I guess there's nothing more to say
love can make you blind, make you act so strange
but I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry
yes everyday I fall
do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
'til then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by
and everyday I fall
it makes me wonder why,
my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
to make my heart be still
'cos every way there is to cry,
ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no ,no ,no
you'll never know just how close we were
you'll never know, no, no, no ,no ,no
you'll never know
no you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
but I know that things won't change
how we feel, how life goes on
and that seems so strange

And so the light fades away
try, try, try as I may
I can't stop thinking about you
it seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
to make my heart be still
'til then every way there is to cry,
ourselves to sleep, we will

Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard
everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

Would I Lie To You?

Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?

My friends, know what's in store.
I won't be here anymore.
I've packed my bags
I've cleaned the floor.
Watch me walkin'.
Walkin' out the door.

Believe me, I'll make it make it
Believe me, I'll make it make it

Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?

Tell you straight, no intervention.
To your face, no deception.
You're the biggest fake.
That much is true.
Had all I can take.
Now I'm leaving you

Believe me, I'll make it make it
Believe me, I'll make it make it

Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?

Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?

My friends, know what's in store.
I won't be here anymore.

Lyrics:
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Say you don't know me
Or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla
Sinking in your fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Someone always playing
Corporation games
Who cares they're always changing
Corporation names
We just want to dance here
Someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
Write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the chokehold, oh
And we just lost the beat
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Coming through your schools

I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Built this city (Oo-ho)
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah

Lyrics
How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me,
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face
Ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds and that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now, cause there's just an empty space

But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now, cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take

Take a look at me now

Lyrics:

You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the Scylla and Charibdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger

I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turn into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
But I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
And you will see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air you'll never find me
I will turn your flesh to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master

And you'll be wrapped around my finger

Ha! It's poetry in motion
She turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

Mm, but she blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!)
And failed me in biology, yeah

Huh-huh
When I'm dancing close to her
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)
I can smell the chemicals
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)

Mm, now but it's poetry in motion
And when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

She blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!)
And failed me in geometry

When she's dancing next to me
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)
I can hear machinery
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)

Hah! It's poetry in motion
And now she's making love to me
The spheres are in commotion
The elements in harmony

She blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!)
And hit me with technology

(Good heavens, Miss Sakamoto! You're beautiful!)

I don't believe it, there she goes again
She's tidied up and I can't find anything
All my tubes and wires and careful notes
And antiquated notions

But, it's poetry in motion
And when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

Uh, she blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!)
She blinded me with

Lyrics:

Tell me what's wrong with society
When everywhere I look, I see
Young girls dying to be on TV
They won't stop till they've reached their dreams

Diet pills, surgery
Photoshopped pictures in magazines
Telling them how they should be
It doesn't make sense to me

Is everybody going crazy?
Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on?
If you open your eyes
You'll see that something is wrong

I guess things are not how they used to be
There's no more normal families
Parents act like enemies
Making kids feel like it's World War III

No one cares, no one's there
I guess we're all just too damn busy
And money's our first priority
It doesn't make sense to me

Is everybody going crazy?
Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on?
If you open your eyes
You'll see that something is wrong

Is everybody going crazy?
Is everybody going crazy?

Tell me what's wrong with society
When everywhere I look I see
Rich guys driving big SUVs
While kids are starving in the streets

No one cares
No one likes to share
I guess life's unfair

Is everybody going crazy?
Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on?
If you open your eyes
You'll see that something, something is wrong

Is everybody going crazy?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on?
If you open your eyes
You'll see that something is wrong

Lyrics
One more night, one more night
I've been trying ooh so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if I stumble if I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see

Please give me one more night, give me one more night
One more night cos I can't wait forever
Give me just one more night, oh just one more night
Oh one more night cos I can't wait forever

I've been sitting here so long
Wasting time, just staring at the phone
And I was wondering should I call you
Then I thought maybe you're not alone

Please give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
Please give me one more night, ooh just one more night
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever

Like a river to the sea
I will always be with you
And if you sail away
I will follow you

Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever

OWNER OF A LONELY HEART

Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or loser

See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you - and that's the only way

Shake - shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
tumby
Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before

Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You - lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed
tumby
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

After my own decision
They confused me so
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
And don't you hesitate at all - no no
Owner of a lonely heart
tumby
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
[repeat]

Owner of a lonely heart
tumby
Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start

Owner of a lonely heart
tumby
Owner of a lonely heart

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it

LYRICS: 

Ooh and I need you now 
But it’s infatuation  
⇧ repeat 
 
Love is the drug  
All my diction disappears for her  
And I’ve been listening too long to 
Lucifer 
 
Something is wrong 
This obscene occupation 
What a drag to drag you down  
Into infatuation 
 
You’re my Latest 
Sick obsession  
(And I need you now) 
You’re my latest  
Sick obsession 
(But it’s infatuation) 
⇧ repeat 
 
Pale is the moon  
Pay attention if you’re counting stars 
‘Cause Mephistopheles would love to leave you scars  
 
And Something is wrong 
With this blank invitation  
To retrieve your outworn evening gowns 
Shooting my brain 
Little shots of salvation 
What a drag to drag you down 
Into infatuation  
 
CHORUS  
 
You’re my Latest 
Sick obsession  
I could watch you *** **** ********* 
You’re my Latest

Lyrics

I can’t believe this mess we’re in 
Tell me where do I begin 
‘Cause it’s making me head spin 
And I can just feel it 
 
It’s never been so loud and clear 
I wish that I could disappear 
To a place that’s far from here 
‘Cause I can just feel it 
 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
 
Yeah, wake me up when this nightmare’s over 
Yeah, make it stop it won’t last much longer 
I wanna get away but I can’t escape 
Try to run but I’m going nowhere 
Yeah, wake me up when this nightmare’s over 
 
When did this stop making sense 
When did dreams get left for dead 
How the hell did we forget 
That nothing else matters 
 
If we hit the lowest low 
There’s only one place left to go 
And I won’t just give up hope 
‘Cause nothing else matters 
 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
 
Yeah, wake me up when this nightmare’s over 
Yeah, make it stop it won’t last much longer 
I wanna get away but I can’t escape 
Try to run but I’m going nowhere 
Yeah, wake me up when this nightmare’s over 
 
Tell me we’ll be alright (when this nightmare’s over) 
Tell me we’ll be alright (when this nightmare’s over) 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
 
Yeah, wake me up when this nightmare’s over 
Yeah, make it stop it won’t last much longer 
I wanna get away but I can’t escape 
Try to run but I’m going nowhere 
Yeah, wake me up when this nightmare’s over 
 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
Tell me we’ll be alright (wake me up when this nightmare’s over) 
 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
Tell me we’ll be alright 
Tell me we’ll be alright (wake me up when this nightmare’s over)

Lyrics
I need love, love
Ooh, to ease my mind
And I need to find time
Someone to call mine
My mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes

How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I've grown impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hanging on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
Well, it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes
And now break!

Now love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
Hold me tight

I keep waiting
Till that day
But it ain't easy, no (Love don't come easy)
You know it ain't easy
My mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait

Lyrics:

That's it, that's it

I fall asleep by the telephone (Telephone)
It's two o'clock and I'm waiting up alone
Tell me where have you been? (where have you been?)
I found a note with another name (Another name)
You blow a kiss, but it just don't feel the same
'Cause I can feel that you're gone (Feel that you're gone)

I can't bite my tongue forever
While you try to play it cool
You can hide behind your stories
But don't take me for a fool

You can tell me that there's nobody else (But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself (But I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But I know, I know
Your love is just a lie (Lie, lie)
It's nothing but a lie (Lie, lie)

You look so innocent (So innocent)
But the guilt in your voice gives you away
Yeah, you know what I mean (Know what I mean)
How does it feel when you kiss when you know that I trust you
And do you think about me when he fucks you?
Could you be more obscene? (Be more obscene)

So don't try to say you're sorry
Or try to make it right
Don't waste your breath because it's too late, it's too late

You can tell me that there's nobody else (But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself (But I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But I know, I know
Your love is just a lie (Lie)
It's nothing but a lie (Lie)
You're nothing but a lie

You can tell me that there's nobody else (But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself (But I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But I know, I know
Your love is just a lie
I know you're nothing but a lie (Lie)
You're nothing but a lie (Lie)
Your love is just a lie

Lyrics:

Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Don't stand so close to me
Please don't stand so close to me

Lyrics
Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out what I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
I can't see but I feel it
And it helps to keep me warm
So I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind

Seems so long I've been waiting
Still don't know what for
There's no point escaping
I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can't turn off my feelings
Like they're turning off a light
But I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind

So take, take me home
Cos I don't remember
Take, take me home
Cos I don't remember
Take, take me home
Cos I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
Cos I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you

Take that look of worry, mine's an ordinary life
Working when it's daylight
And sleeping when it's night
I've got no far horizons
I don't wish upon a star
They don't think that I listen
Oh but I know who they are
And I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind
Oh I, I don't mind
No I, I don't mind

So take, take me home
Cos I don't remember
Take, take me home
Cos I don't remember
Take, take me home
Cos I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
Well I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you

But I don't remember
Take, take me home...

Lyrics:

Take a breath
I pull myself together
Just another step
Until I reach the door
You'll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you

(Oh, oh) I wish that I could tell you something
(Oh, oh) To take it all away

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know

When I hear your voice
It's drowning in a whisper
It's just skin and bones
There's nothing left to take
And no matter what I do, I can't make you feel better

(Oh, oh) If only I could find the answer
(Oh, oh) To help me understand

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know

That if you fall, stumble down
I'll pick you up off the ground
If you lose faith in you
I'll give you strength to pull through
Tell me you won't give up 'cause I'll be waiting if you fall
You know, I'll be there for you

(Oh, oh) If only I could find the answer
(Oh, oh) To take it all away

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever I want you to know

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I could save you
I want you to know
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I could save you

LYRICS
Well I woke up to the sound of silence 
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight 
And I found you with a bottle of wine 
Your head in the curtains 
And heart like the Fourth of July 

You swore and said 
We are not 
We are not shining stars 
This I know 
I never said we are 

Though I've never been through hell like that 
I've closed enough windows 
To know you can never look back 

If you're lost and alone 
Or you're sinking like a stone 
Carry on 
May your past be the sound 
Of your feet upon the ground 
Carry on 

Carry on, carry on 

So I met up with some friends 
At the edge of the night 
At a bar off 75 
And we talked and talked 
About how our parents will die 
All our neighbours and wives 

But I like to think 
I can cheat it all 
To make up for the times I've been cheated on 
And it's nice to know 
When I was left for dead 
I was found and now I don't roam these streets 
I am not the ghost you want of me 

If you're lost and alone 
Or you're sinking like a stone 
Carry on 
May your past be the sound 
Of your feet upon the ground 
Carry on 

Woah 
My head is on fire 
But my legs are fine 
Cause after all they are mine 
Lay your clothes down on the floor 
Close the door 
Hold the phone 
Show me how 
No one's ever gonna stop us now 

Cause we are 
We are shining stars 
We are invincible 
We are who we are 
On our darkest day 
When we're miles away 
So we'll come 
We will find our way home 

If you're lost and alone 
Or you're sinking like a stone 
Carry on 
May your past be the sound 
Of your feet upon the ground 
Carry on 

Carry on, carry on

Lyrics:

I'm looking in the rearview mirror 
Everything looks the same 
There's nothing but broken streetlights 
And I'm just trying to escape  

I'm waiting on a distant feeling 
I'm waiting for things to change 
It's getting hard to run on empty 
But maybe I'm not so far away 
Cuz it feels like home 

I found a reason 
And suddenly I'm not so alone 
I'm finally breathing 
Like I never could on my own 
Start the countdown 
Let's get it on 
Scream my lungs out  
To our favourite song 
'Cause this is where I belong 

I can tell you just don't get it 
And that you'll never understand 
I'm sorry that I can't be perfect 
But I'm not changing who I am 

Maybe there's no destination 
Maybe I'm gonna make mistakes 
I'll let you in on one of my secrets 
I’m still just as lost as yesterday 
But it feels like home 

Look past the warning signs 
The same ones that told me 
I should just turn back and run 
Play it safe before you come undone 
If you saw through my eyes 
This view was worth the climb 
Believe me when I say 
There's no place in this world I'd rather be

Lyrics
Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you

So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion
Oooooh
I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you

So baby talk to me
Like lovers do

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
(Here it comes again, here it comes again)
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you",2024-01-20T01:48:37Z,TzFnYcIqj6I

Shock! Shock! Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey

Lyrics:

Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it",2024-01-20T01:48:04Z,JkRKT6T0QLg

LYRICS
I've got enough on my mind
That when she pulls me by the hair
She hasn't much to hold onto
She's keeping count on her hand
One, two, three days that I've been
Sleeping on my side

I finished kissing my death
So now I head back up the steps
Thinking about where I've been
I mean the sun was never like this
I want to feel with the seasons
I guess it makes sense
Cause my life's become as vapid as
A night out in Los Angeles
And I just want to stay in bed

And hold you like I used to
You know that I am home
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?

Or go on, go on, go on
If you are thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?

She got enough on her mind
That she feel no sorrow
I let my fate fill the air
So now she's rolling down the window
Never been on to hold on
But I need a last grasp
So I ask if she remembers when
She used to come and visit man
We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong

Go on, go on, go on
If you're thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I think I kinda like it
But I might have had too much

I'll move back down
To this western town
When they find me out
Make no mistake about it

Go on, go on, go on
If you are thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?

For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I think I kinda like it
But I might have had too much

I'll move back down

Lyrics
Who's that girl?

The language of love
Slips from my lover's tongue
Cooler than ice cream
And warmer than the sun
Dumb hearts get broken
Just like china cups
The language of love
Has left me broken on the rocks

But there's just one thing
(Just one thing)
But there's just one thing
And I really wannna know

Who's that girl
Running around with you?
Tell me
Who's that girl
Running around with you?

The language of love
Has left me stony grey
Tongue tied and twisted
At the price I've had to pay
Your careless notions
Have silenced these emotions
Look at all the foolishness
Your lover's talk has done",2024-01-20T01:47:29Z,-5iDKWV6Chg

Lyrics:

I heard you're doing OK
But I want you to know
I'm a dick
I'm addicted to you
I can't pretend I don't care
When you don't think about me
Do you think I deserve this?

I tried to make you happy
But you left anyway

I'm trying to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it and I need it
I'm addicted to you
Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never wanna do this again
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker

Since the day I met you
And after all we've been through
Still a dick
I'm addicted to you
I think you know that it's true
I'd run a thousand miles to get you
Do you think I deserve this?

I tried to make you happy
I did all that I could
Just to keep you
But you left anyway

I'm trying to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it and I need it
I'm addicted to you
Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never wanna do this again
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker

How long will I be waiting?
Until the end of time
I don't know why I'm still waiting
I can't make you mine

I'm trying to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it and I need it
I'm addicted to you

I'm trying to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it and I need it
I'm addicted to you

Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never wanna do this again

Avicii - Wake Me Up (Official Video),"”It’s so far away from anything I’ve ever done before musically, so it’s obviously a weight off my shoulders that everything went the way it did” — Tim ’Avicii’ Bergling.
 
June 17th 2023 marks one decade since the release of Wake Me Up – a song that came to change EDM music forever. As a key part of the album True, Wake Me Up was one of the songs where Avicii showed the world his ability to blend different genres — transcending the boundaries of ages, music preferences, and cultures worldwide.

In loving memory of Tim Bergling (1989-2018).

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know

You could have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

I want to be - your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
Oh  let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony

Show me round your fruitcage
'Cos I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruitcage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be

I want to be - your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
You'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be - the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it

Sledge Sledge Sledgehammer

I've kicked the habit, shed my skin
This is the new stuff, I go dancing in, we go dancing in

Oh won't you show for me and I will show for you
Show for me, I will show for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean you, only you
You've been coming through
Going to build that power
Build, build up that power, hey
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
Going to feel that power build in you

Come on, come on, help me do
Come on, come on, help me do
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh , yeh, yeh, you
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
It's what we're doing, doing

Lyrics

I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try
I try

Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion

Don't believe

About David Bowie:
David Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers. Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust…, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, ""Heroes,” Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie’s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.

Jump down the shelters to get away

Tell us general, is it party time?
If it is, can we all come?

LYRICS
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore...
oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh
oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh

This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked, but here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright; I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Oh, who am I? mmm... mmm...

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win, I always win...

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know... (come on)

So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on
Oh, come on. Oh, come on, OH COME ON!

Well, this is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home; Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call ""love""
But when I look into my nephew's eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...
Some terrible nights...ahhh...

oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh
oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... oh...
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... oh...

Lyrics: 

Who can it be knockingat my door?
Go away, don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired and I'm not feeling right
All I wish is to be alone
Stay away, don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?""",2024-01-20T01:41:19Z,SECVGN4Bsgg

Song Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm wearing-a fur pajamas
I ride a hot potato
It's tickling my fancy
Speak up, I can't hear you

[Chorus]
Here on this mountaintop, oh-oh-oh
I got some wild, wild life
I got some news to tell you, oh-oh
About some wild, wild life
Here come the doctor in charge, oh-oh-oh
She's got some wild, wild life
Ain't that the way you like it, oh-oh?
Living wild, wild life

[Verse 2]
I'll wrestle with your conscience
You wrestle with your partner
Sitting on a windowsill
But he spends his time behind closed doors

[Chorus] 
So check out mister businessman, oh-oh-oh
He bought some wild, wild life
On the way to the stock exchange, oh-oh-oh
He got some wild, wild life
Pick it up when he opens the door, oh-oh-oh
He doing wild, wild life
I know it's the way you like it, oh-oh
Living wild, wild

[Verse 3]
Peace of mind
It's a piece of cake
Thought control
You get on board any time you like
Like sitting on pins and needles
Things fall apart
It's scientific

[Chorus]
Sleeping on the Interstate, oh-oh-oh
Getting wild, wild life
Checking in and checking out, oh-oh-oh
I got 'em, wild, wild life
Spending all of my money and time, oh-oh-oh
On too much wild, wild life
We wanna go and we go where we go, oh-oh-oh
Ah, doing wild, wild life
I know it, that's how we start, oh-oh-oh
Got some wild, wild life
Take a picture here in the daylight, oh-oh
And it's a wild, wild life
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fast, oh-oh-oh
Wild, wild
And I know that's the way you like it, oh-oh
Living wild, wild, wild, wild life

Lyrics
 
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Hold your head up, keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas ",2024-01-20T01:41:10Z,qeMFqkcPYcg

Lyrics:
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Lyrics
You have saved me from the deepness of my mind,
You control whatever seems to make it right,
So, take it slow, cause I´ll take it slow
And make you know you´ll always be the one.

So, come on darling
Take away my pain
Cause all we know is
This love will grow, we can´t let go.

Come on take my hand and discover.
Come on take my hand and be a part of something else,
Come on take my hand and discover.
That all I need is you,
All I need is you
All I need is you 

I will cave into the sweetness of your eyes,
Set free myself from darkness into light.
And please take care of me, cause I´ll take care of you
I won´t sacrifice my one and only prize.

So, come on darling
Take away my pain
Cause all we know is
This love will grow, we can´t let go.

Come on take my hand and discover.
Come on take my hand and be a part of something else,
Come on take my hand and discover.
That all I need is you,
All I need is you
All I need is you 

I know, 
I will never let you down,
When you have no one around.
I will never let you down, let you down.

Come on take my hand and discover.
Come on take my hand and be a part of something else.


Come on take my hand and discover.
Come on take my hand and be a part of something else,
Come on take my hand and discover.
That all I need is you,
All I need is you.

Lyrics

Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shakin' to the top
The sheik he drove his Cadillac
He went a' cruisnin' down the ville
The muezzin was a' standing
On the radiator grille

The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb
As soon as the shareef
Had cleared the square
They began to wail

The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
The temple band took five
The crowd caught a wiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

The king called up his jet fighters
He said you better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way

As soon as the shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare

As soon as the shareef was
Outta their hair
The jet pilots wailed

The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
The shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
He thinks it's not kosher
Fundamentally he can't take it.
You know he really hates it.",2024-01-20T01:38:22Z,bJ9r8LMU9bQ

Lyrics:
Army with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em

OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P... well... that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin', bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

[Chorus]
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), you down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), who's down with OPP (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), you down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), who's down with OPP (All the homies)

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it... ah... sorta properly
I say the last P... hmmm... stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Chorus]

This girl ah tried to OPP me, I had a girl and she knew that 
matter-of-fact my girl was partner's that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn-- skippy I'm with it

[Chorus]

Break it down!",2024-01-20T01:37:40Z,7f7FuDagYLU

LYRICS
Give me a second I,
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a glass
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight

Lyrics:

You get a shiver in the dark
It’s raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel all right when you hear that music ring

You step inside but you don’t see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Too much competition too many other places
But not too many horns can make that sound
Way on downsouth way on downsouth London town

You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords
Mind he’s strictly rhythm he doesn’t want to make it cry or sing
And an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn’t mind if he doesn’t make the scene
He’s got a daytime job he’s doing alright
He can play honky tonk just like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys they’re fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don’t give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain’t what they call rock and roll
And the Sultans played Creole

And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
‘Thank you goodnight now it’s time to go home’
and he makes it fast with one more thing
‘We are the Sultans of Swing'

Lyrics: 

Jump down the shelters to get away
The boys are cocking up their guns
Tell us general, is it party time?
If it is, can we all come?

Don't think that we don't know
Don't think that we're not trying
Don't think we move too slow
It's no use after crying

Saying Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill""",2024-01-20T01:36:22Z,RY7S6EgSlCI

Lyrics: 
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

Lyrics

Open your eyes
Look at the light on
Whispers move around my waking head. 
Step in the light
You got nothing to hide, no.

Open your mind, 
Look at the light on, 
Promises are better left unsaid. 
Step in the light
You've got nothing to hide, no.

I wanted to remind you how this feels,  
The truth will never blind you from your fears, 
Hold to something unforgettable, to carry on.

Surrounded, by all the light. 
Surrounded, by all the light. 
Open your eyes. 

Open your eyes, 
Look at the right one, 
The many ways of walking the same road.
Step in the light
You've got nothing to hide, no.

How many times, you gonna try?
You gotta fight, just let me know.
It’s in your mind, set all aside,
Don’t ever hide, 
You´re stuck in all you've got,
You´re stuck in everything you've got.
Get up!

I wanted to remind you how this feels,  
The truth will never blind you from what’s real, 
Hold to something unforgettable, to carry on.

Surrounded, by all the light. 
Surrounded, by all the light. 

When darkness falls and all we need is change, 
The deepness of our thoughts can feed us pain

I’m blinded by this light inside,
That keeps me going, till I die. 
The gift I lived the greatest life
Will keep me moving on.

Surrounded, by all the light. 
Surrounded, by all the light. 
Surrounded, by all the light. 
Surrounded, by all the light. 
Surrounded, by all the light. 
Surrounded, by all the light. 
Open your eyes.

Lyrics:

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you're screaming?

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy, but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work, it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like (What it's like)

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life

Lyrics:
We’re no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of
You wouldn’t get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We’ve known each other for so long
Your heart’s been aching but you’re too shy to say it
Inside we both know what’s been going on
We know the game and we’re gonna play it

And if you ask me how I’m feeling
Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Lyrics:
The house of pain is in effect ya'll
The house of pain is in effect
You know the house of pain is in effect
And anyone that steps up is gettin' wrecked
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (c'mon!) c'mon throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump across the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's hoe
Feelin, funkin, amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (17X)
I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel, to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to Kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (17X)
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to play me out like, as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
it up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!
Jump around! (3X)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! (33X)
Yo, this is dedicated.. to Joe..DeBerg..Dakota!
Grab your bozack, punk!

Lyrics

Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone
Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to me the sooner or later, oh
Holding back the years
Chance for me to escape from all I know
Holding back the tears
'Cause nothing here has grown
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could, yeah, oh
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on, so tight
Alright, oh now
Well, I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all of those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
'Cause nothing ever could, oh yeah
Oh
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
Holding
Holding
Holding
Holding, la-la-la, la, la-la
I said, ooh, yeah
That's all I have today
It's all I have to say

Simply Red have over a billion hits on YouTube, have sold over 60 million albums worldwide, 5 going to number one in the UK.

Zach Bryan - Something In The Orange,"It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you baby,
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy,
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw,
I don't know much but there's no weight at all,
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't,
'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't, 
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun,
Something in the orange tells me we're not done, 

To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am, 
Where the hell am I 'supposed to go? 
I poisoned myself again, 
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home,
If you leave today I’ll just stare at the way, 
The orange touches all things around, 
The grass trees and dew, how I just hate you,
Please turn those headlights around, 

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night,
There’s orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light, 
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak, 
Take me back to us dancing this wood used to creak, 

To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am, 
Where the hell am I 'supposed to go? 
I poisoned myself again, 
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home,
If you leave today I’ll just stare at the way, 
The orange touches all things around, 
The grass trees and dew, how I just hate you,
Please turn those headlights around, 

To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am, 
Where the hell am I 'supposed to go? 
I poisoned myself again, 
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home,
If you leave today I’ll just stare at the way, 
The orange touches all things around, 
The grass trees and dew, how I just hate you,
Please turn those headlights around,

Lyrics:

Hey, dad, look at me
Think back and talk to me
Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I'm wasting my time
Doing things I wanna do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that I'm alright
And you can't change me

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

I try not to think
About the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me
Now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight
And nothing's alright

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
And nothing's gonna make this right again (Right again)
Please don't turn your back
I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you
But you don't understand (You don't understand)

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

We recently became aware of a blogpost entitled “Everybody Still Hurts” (https://found.ee/KRPny9) highlighting the R.E.M. song “Everybody Hurts” and its groundbreaking video, both released 32 years ago.  The song and video remain resonant worldwide and in real people’s lives. The blog author broke down people’s comments on YouTube from expressing pain, sharing memories of a loved one, to notes of encouragement and positivity - but wonders why there isn’t a Suicide Hotline telephone number listed for people who need it right then.

Lyrics:

Another day is going by
I'm thinking about you all the time
But you're out there and I'm here waiting
And I wrote this letter in my head
'Cause so many things were left unsaid
But now you're gone and I can't think straight

This could be the one last chance to make you understand, yeah

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
'Cause I know I won't forget you

Together we broke all the rules
Dreaming of dropping out of school
And leave this place but never come back
So now, maybe after all these years
If you miss me, have no fear
I'll be here, I'll be waiting

This could be the one last chance to make you understand
And I just can't let you leave me once again, yeah

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
'Cause I know I won't forget you

I close my eyes
And all I see is you
I close my eyes
I try to sleep, I can't forget you
Na na na, na na na
And I'd do anything for you
Na na na, na na na, na

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
To fall asleep with you
With you, yeah

I'd do anything
To fall asleep with you
I'd do anything
There's nothing I won't do (I'd do anything)
To fall asleep with you (I'd do anything)
'Cause I know I won't forget you

Lyrics:

I woke up, it was seven, I waited 'til eleven
Just to figure out that no one would call
I think I've got a lot of friends, but I don't hear from them
What's another night all alone?
When you're spending everyday on your own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me
Tonight

And maybe when the night is dead, I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

What the hell is wrong with me? Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?
Wide awake I'm bored and I can't fall asleep
And every night is the worst night ever

I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid, yeah, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
And I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight

I'm all alone tonight
Nobody cares tonight
'Cause I'm just a kid tonight

Lyrics:

Barcelona
I still long to hold her once more, oh
My boots of leather
From Europe
I gather you know, know

Every time you have to go
Shut my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

A native man sang in a foreign tongue
I still ache to know the song that he sung
Barcelona

Every time you have to go
Shut my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

Every time you have to go
Shut my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

Every time you have to go
I shut my mind and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona

Play that song
The one that makes me go allnight long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do

Hey mister DJ when you gonna spin it
My baby's favorite record
She been waiting for a minute
She invited all her friends
And I'm buying all the rounds
And they're all dolled up
DJ please don't let me down

When you gonna play that song, now
When you gonna earn that pay
When you gonna play that song
And make my day""",2024-01-20T01:15:20Z,J5qWnG5RQTk

Lyrics:

When we were young, when life began,
We needed nothing, just having fun
We rode along, we came in strong,
We took our chances, we carried on...

Singing…. Ohhh ohhh

When life began, we chased the sun, 
We lived as brothers, we wanted all.
For many years, we had no fears,
We all discovered, we wanted more... 

We jumped to this wild like playing
Best days live inside of our minds,
Moved the way we wanted
This is how it started
feeling what is true in our heart

All we have to do is, not let go 
Time will pass but our true love grows
It’s been so long,
Do you remember
When life began?
When life began?

When we were young, when life began
We had each other, we felt as one
For many years, we held our fears
We all discovered, we wanted more

We jumped to the wild like playing
Best days live inside of our minds,
Moved the way we wanted
This is how it started
feeling what is true in our heart

All we have to do is, not let go 
Time will pass but our true love grows
It’s been so long,
Do you remember
When life began?
When life began?

Every day is a new day
Every day is a new chance
Everyone has love to give,
That’s why we live, that’s why we live! 

All we have to do is, not let go 
Time will pass but our true love grows
It’s been so long,
Do you remember
When life began?
When life began?

It's A Beautiful Day Lyrics: 
I don't know why
You think that you could hold me
When you can't get by by yourself
And I don't know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends
While I came up with that line and I'm sure
That it's for the best
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath

'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
When you said goodbye, my whole world shines

Hey hey hey
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If I'm drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You won't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away
It's a beautiful day

It's my turn to fly, so girls, get in line
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
Now I'm alright
Might've had me caged before, but not tonight

'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
This fire inside, it burns too bright
I don't want to say ""so long"", I just want to say ""goodbye""

Hey hey hey
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If I'm drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You won't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away

'Cause if you ever think I'll take up
My time with thinking of our break-up
Then, you've got another thing coming your way
'Cause it's a beautiful day
Beautiful day
Oh, baby, any day that you're gone away
It's a beautiful day

Lyrics:
Guess I’m a mess now
Lost with my head down
I haven’t heard from you in weeks 
You must have left town 
I can’t go back now
And all that I have now
Are those feelings I felt
Knowing that no one else can bring them back out 
And I’ve been trying to find a silver lining 
But I can’t
But I can’t 
Now that I can’t hold you
I wish that I had tried to
Do more not to lose you
Now that I can’t find you
Cuz the second you left, yeah, the voice in my head screamed “What did i do?” 
Now you’re gone and all I want is someone like you 
Someone like you (someone like you) 
Someone like you (someone like you) 
It all makes sense now
But I can’t repent now
Because I’m stuck like a grave in the space that you left With no reason to get out 
And I’ve been trying to find a silver lining 
But I can’t
Oh I can’t 
Now that I can’t hold you
I wish that I had tried to
Do more not to lose you
Now that I can’t find you
Cuz the second you left, yeah, the voice in my head screamed “What did I do?” 
Now you’re gone and all I want is someone like you 
Someone like you (someone like you) 
Someone like you (someone like you) 
And I’ve been trying to find a silver lining 
But I can’t 
Now that I can’t hold you
I wish that I had tried to
Do more not to lose you
Now that I can’t find you
Cuz the second you left, yeah, the voice in my head screamed “What did i do?” 
Now you’re gone and all I want is someone like you 
Someone like you (someone like you) 
Someone like you (someone like you)

Lyrics

I walk past the buildings of an architect's un-imagination
Returning to the venue where we had that very first conversation
To see you again, to be your friend, to hold you in my mind

And I arrived there early and as always you swanned in much later
As if nothing had ever changed, you nod at me and order your double mixer
To see you again, to be your friend, to hold you in my mind

Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you

And I've been told your new playmate's successful and he's handsome and he's charming
It's a damn good job, he isn't here or I may have wind up harming your darling
To see you again, to be your friend, to hold you in my mind

Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to youLeaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to youLeaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to youLeaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you

We laughing and we joking like we always, always used to
Too rudely interrupted by your half-wit of a boyfriend who tries to call you
To see you again, to be your friend, to hold you in his mind

Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you
Leaving it up, leaving it up, leaving it up
Leaving it up to you",2024-01-20T00:56:58Z,XZ7R5rfyCAs

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know, it's goodbye again
And I wish you could tell me, why do we always fight when I have to go

Everybody Wants To Rule The World Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

[Chorus]
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 2]
It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the

[Chorus]
Most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Bridge]
There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you

[Chorus]
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the—
Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world
All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

Lyrics:

Honey, come over
The party’s gone slower
And no one will tempt you
We know you got sober 

There’s orange juice in the kitchen
Bought for the children
It’s yours if you want it
We’re just glad you could visit 

Feels like I’ve been ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn’t think to ask you where you’d gone
So why’d you go?

And you said 
And you said 

You said my heart has changed 
and my soul has changed 
and my heart and my heart 

That my face has changed 
and I haven’t drank 
in six months on the dot 

See the graves as you pass through 
From our crash back in 02’
Not one nick on your finger 
You just asked me to hold you

But it made you a stranger
And filled you with anger
Now I’m third in the lineup
To your lord and your savior

Feels like I’ve been ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn’t think to ask you where you’d gone
So why’d you go?

And you said
And you said

You said my heart has changed 
and my soul has changed 
and my heart and my heart 

That my life has changed 
That this town had changed
And you had not

That the world had changed 
and don’t you find it strange 
that you just went ahead and carried on?

And you know I’d say 
The last time I drank
I was face down passed out there on your lawn

Are we all just crows to you now?
Are we all just pulling you down?
You didn't put those bones in the ground 
You didn’t put those bones in the ground

Honey, come over
The party’s gone slower
And no one will tempt you
We know you got sober 

There’s orange juice in the kitchen
Bought for the children 
It’s yours if you want it
We’re just glad you could visit

Shut the door, unplug the phone

Build a castle out of sandIt don't matter now
Well it won't last and it won't stand

But with a suitcase in your hand
It don't matter now
Well I don't think about that stuff
No, I don't think about that stuff
It don't matter now

A bad man running your hometown
Surf your way on through the crowd

Change your name, you won't be found
It don't matter now

Well I don't think about that stuff
No, I don't think about that stuff

Lyrics: 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay

The Beatles - When I'm Sixty Four (Official Video),"""When I'm Sixty-Four"" is a song by the English rock band The Beatles, written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney) and released on their 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. McCartney wrote the song when he was about 14, probably in April or May 1956, and it was one of the first songs he ever wrote. The song was recorded in a key different from the final recording; it was sped up at the request of McCartney to make his voice sound younger. It prominently features a trio of clarinets (two regular clarinets and one bass clarinet) throughout. 

Recording:
The Beatles recorded two takes of the song on 6 December 1966, during one of the first sessions for the as-yet-unnamed album that became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Martin produced, supported by engineers Geoff Emerick and Phil McDonald. McCartney overdubbed his lead vocal onto take two without the other Beatles present on 8 December. On 20 December, McCartney, Lennon and George Harrison overdubbed backing vocals and Ringo Starr added the sound of bells.

Martin made two reduction mixes (takes three and four) with the latter best. On 21 December, session musicians Robert Burns, Henry MacKenzie and Frank Reidy overdubbed two clarinets and a bass clarinet onto take four. Emerick later explained, ""The clarinets on that track became a very personal sound for me; I recorded them so far forward that they became one of the main focal points."" Martin recalled, ""I remember recording it in the cavernous Number One studio at Abbey Road and thinking how the three clarinet players looked as lost as a referee and two linesmen alone in the middle of Wembley Stadium."" On the same day, Martin remixed the song for mono three times, although this was only a demo version. He made four new mono mixes on 29 December.

On 30 December, unsatisfied with all of these attempts, McCartney suggested speeding up the track to raise it by around a semitone from its original key of C major to D♭ major. Martin remembers that McCartney suggested this change to make his voice sound younger. McCartney says, ""I wanted to appear younger, but that was just to make it more rooty-tooty; just lift the key because it was starting to sound turgid."" Martin, Emerick and Richard Lush made the sped-up remix from take four on 17 April 1967. Musicologist Michael Hannan comments on the completed track: ""The rich timbres of the clarinets give the mix a fuller, fatter sound than many of the other tracks on the album.""

Release:
The song was nearly released on a single as the B-side of either ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" or ""Penny Lane"". It was instead held over to be included as an album track for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Everett comments that the protagonist of ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" is sometimes associated with the Lonely Hearts Club Band concept, but in his opinion the song is thematically unconnected to others on the album.

According to author George Case, all of the songs on Sgt. Pepper were perceived by contemporary listeners as being drug-inspired, with 1967 marking the pinnacle of LSD's influence on pop music. Some fans viewed the lyric ""digging the weeds"" from ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" as a possible drug allusion. In August 1967, The Beatles Book published an article discussing whether the album was ""too advanced for the average pop fan"". One reader complained that all the songs except ""Sgt. Pepper"" and ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" were ""over our heads"", adding, ""The Beatles ought to stop being so clever and give us tunes we can enjoy.""

""When I'm Sixty-Four"" was included in the Beatles' 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine. It was also used over the opening credits of the 1982 film The World According to Garp.

Giles Martin remixed the song for inclusion on the album's 50th anniversary release in 2017. Martin mixed the song from the original tapes rather than their subsequent mixdowns. Take 2 of the song was included as a bonus track on the deluxe edition.

Lyrics: 

Don't get me wrong
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by

Don't get me wrong
If you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
Is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

Don't get me wrong
If I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks
That go off when you smile

Don't get me wrong
If I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander
Across a moonlit mile

Once in awhile
Two people meet
Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street
Suddenly thunder, showers everywhere
Who can explain the thunder and rain
But there's something in the air

Don't get me wrong
If I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow
But hopeless yesterday

Don't get me wrong
If I fall in the 'mode of passion'
It might be unbelievable
But let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic
Don't get me wrong

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 1]
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Interlude]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 2]
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Bridge]
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and went on to become one of the most influential, innovative, and successful groups in modern music, having sold more than 300 million albums worldwide. The band rose from the ashes of The Yardbirds, when Jimmy Page brought in John Bonham, John Paul Jones, and Robert Plant to tour as The New Yardbirds. In 1969, Led Zeppelin released its self-titled debut which was produced by Page, as were all the subsequent albums. It marked the beginning of a 12-year reign, during which the group was widely considered to be the biggest and most innovative rock band in the world.",2023-11-08T01:58:19Z,QkF3oxziUI4

Song Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Ah, watch out
You might get what you're after
Cool babies
Strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

[Verse 2]
Hold tight
Wait 'til the party's over
Hold tight
We're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

[Chorus 1]
Here's your ticket, pack your bags
Time for jumpin' overboard
Transportation is here
Close enough but not too far
Maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire

[Verse 3]
Ah, all wet
Hey, you might need a raincoat
Shakedown
Dreams walking in broad daylight
365 degrees
Burning down the house

[Chorus 2]
Ah, it was once upon a place
Sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work
And, baby what do you expect?
Gonna burst into flames, ah
Burning down the house

[Verse 4]
My house
Is out of the ordinary
That's right
Don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house

[Chorus]
No visible means of support
And you have not seen nothin' yet
Everything's stuck together
And I don't know what you expect
Staring into the TV set
Fightin' fire with fire, ah

Lyrics:
Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired, she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep
He can't hang around

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our

Our house it has a crowd
There's always something happening
And it's usually quite loud
Our mum, she's so house-proud
Nothing ever slows her down
And a mess is not allowed

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our
Our house, in the middle of our street

Our house (Something tells you)
(That you've got to move away from it) In the middle of our

Father gets up late for work
Mother has to iron his shirt
Then she sends the kids to school
Sees them off with a small kiss (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
She's the one they're going to miss
In lots of ways

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our

I remember way back then
When everything was true and when
We would have such a very good time
Such a fine time, such a happy time
And I remember how we'd play
Simply waste the day away
Then we'd say nothing would come between us
Two dreamers

Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep
He can't hang around

Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our
Our house, was our castle and our keep
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, that was where we used to sleep
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house

Attention movie directors of gay themed films, if you have made a film or short film that you would like showcased on this channel, please contact me at rexredcopyright@gmail.com If you are a media company and manage the rights to a lot of gay themed movie titles, please contact me and I will edit a portion of each movie and make a short video advertising these films for you. I do not charge a fee for this service. This channel currently receives 1 to 2 million views a month and is constantly growing. Get your film catalogue out to the people who enjoy the genres you curate. I would love to edit your films to an appropriate song and advertise them here on this Flock of Angels channel. I will include whatever info in the video description you like. If I do not respond within a day to your email keep copying and re-sending the email, I do not mind you sending it a good number of times till I see it (I get a lot of emails). When I do see it, I will respond immediately. My subscribers are very appreciative of gay romance and your films may find a very special place in their heart. 💓😘 Even if you are not sure if your film qualifies as ""gay romance"" I can often edit it to portray that idea if there are enough gay romantic scenes. I cannot make promises that I will edit it, I need to see it first. I will try if there is enough compelling gay romantic content. Sometimes all that is needed is one gay kiss to make it work. I hope to hear from you soon, love always, RexRed

Lyrics:
Strangers, from strangers into brothers
From brothers into strangers once again
We saw the whole world but I couldn’t see the meaning
I couldn’t even recognize my friends
 
Older, but nothing’s any different
Right now feels the same I wonder why
I wish they told us, it shouldn’t take a sickness
Or airplanes falling out the sky
 
Do I have to die to hear you miss me
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye
I don’t want to act like there’s tomorrow
I don’t want to wait to do this one more time
One more time, one more, one more time, one more time
 
I miss you, took time but I admit it
It still hurts even after all these years
And I know that next time, ain’t always gonna happen
I gotta say I love you while we’re here
 
Do I have to die to hear you miss me
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye
I don’t want to act like there’s tomorrow
I don’t want to wait to do this one more time
One more time, one more, one more time, one more time
One more time (one more time), one more, one more time (one more time), one more time
I miss you

It's the end of the world as we know it (coronavirus edition) [music video],"It’s the end of the world as we know it
(Original: R.E.M.)

It did not start with an earthquake, 
Birds, snakes, or aero planes, 
No, it was a pangolin.

Five a.m., the husband’s up, 
Ready for another hunt, 
He goes out, but no luck,
Toilet paper’s out of stock, 
Other than that, we’re just fine
Oh my god, we’ll all die.

Schools are closed, the second week
We all try not to breathe
And if you’re sneezing in the street
Everybody literally jumps ten feet

Other than that, we’re just fine
It’s alright
But Doctor Merkel, 
No surprise,
Is feeling 
Pretty psyched.

It’s the end of the world as we know it.
It’s the end of the world as we know it.
It’s the end of the world as we know it.
And I feel fine.

Donald Trump, ain’t he great,
Lets us know he’s not afraid
Two weeks late into the game
He looks for someone else to blame
Johnson – that’s the Englishman –
Has a completely different plan
He’s on the way to eliminate
The most loyal part of his electorate
Other than that, we’re just fine
Right? Right.

It’s the end of the world as we know it.
(It’s time I had some time alone)
It’s the end of the world as we know it.
(It’s time I had some time alone)
It’s the end of the world as we know it.
(It’s time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine.

It’s funny, it’s funny,
It’s funny until it isn’t
Funny anymore.

It’s the end of the world as we know it.
(It’s time I had some time alone)
It’s the end of the world as we know it.
(It’s time I had some time alone)
It’s the end of the world as we know it.
(It’s time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine.",2023-09-24T00:03:19Z,VrzzhxdJ1cE

Lyrics: 

Baby, don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each other's hands?
This time might be the last I fear unless
I make it all too clear I need you so, oh

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings""",2023-09-09T20:27:52Z,nKhN1t_7PEY

LYRICS
Once in your life you'll find her
Someone who turns your heart around
And next thing you know
You're closin' down the town

Wake up and she's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
You're wonderin' to yourself
Hey what've I found

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (the best that you can do)
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does what he pleases
All of his life his master's toys
And deep in his heart
He's just he's just a boy
Livin' his life one day at a time
He's showing himself a really good time
He's laughin' about the way
They want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (the best that you can do)
The best that you can do is fall in love

The lead single “Ride Like The Wind” spent 4 weeks at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and was quickly followed up by Cross’ most popular single to date (and first #1 hit) “Sailing”, which later became known as the archetype for the Yacht Rock genre. In 1981, Cross became the first artist in Grammy history to win the “Big Four” most prestigious awards in a single night; Record of the Year (for the single “Sailing”), Album of the Year, Song of the Year (also “Sailing”), and Best New Artist. Later that year Cross released “Arthur’s Theme (Best That You Can Do)” which he co-wrote with Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer, Peter Allen, and was the title-theme for the 1981 film “Arthur” starring Dudley Moorre and Liza Minnelli. The song earned Cross his second #1 and the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 1981 Academy Awards. Cross’ sophomore album “Another Page” was released in 1983 and featured the singles “Think of Laura” and “All Right”. Cross has sold over 10M albums worldwide and his songs have been covered and sampled by NSYNC, Puff Daddy, Avant, Shirley Bassey, Dione Warwick, and many more.",2023-09-08T01:34:42Z,wJ6zs2WSCjk

Sailing was recorded in 1979, utilizing the 3M Digital Recording System, making it one of the first digitally recorded songs to chart. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on August 30, 1980. The song won Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Arrangement of the Year, and helped Cross win the Best New Artist award. Produced by Michael Omartian, it features Tommy Taylor on drums, Andy Salmon on bass, Rob Meurer on electric piano, and Victor Feldman on percussion. In 1980, Sailing was released as a single in Latin America under the translated (en español) title ""Navegando"".

On the Howard Stern radio show, Cross explained that sailing with his friend got him away from the trials and tribulations of being a teenager. Cross said that if the guy had taken him bowling and he enjoyed it, the song could have become ""Bowling.""

This live video was recorded at Warner Amigo Studios in 1980 and featured a live audio cut (different from the one featured in this upload) for use where the band would be lip-syncing on television, to be more realistic than the missing orchestra. This footage has been digitally enhanced to HD quality and features audio from the 2019 remaster of Cross' 1979 debut self-titled album:

LYRICS
Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

[Instrumental Bridge]

Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Really, believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Data & Picard,"A Pogo remix of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Details below.

Temba, his arms wide! In Tamarian this signifies the giving of a gift, first heard in the excellent episode Darmok. Data & Picard is my tribute to one of the greatest TV series of all time. It is an original track featuring the voices of Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander Data (Brent Spiner), accompanied by a music video I shot entirely in my living room with a green screen and lights.

The track opens with the Klingon Victory Song, followed by a remix of Data singing Che Gelida Manina in the episode 'In Theory'. This episode was the first ever to be directed by Patrick Stewart and I didn't realize this until after the track was finished.

I sourced the Ben Nye makeup that was used to turn Spiner into Data, and a replica of the iconic Star Fleet uniform. Unfortunately I couldn't get the contact lenses in and I could only get the uniform in red, so I spent a huge amount of time changing the colour of my eyes and uniform in post.

The video was shot in Slog 4k ProRes HQ using a Sony A7SII and an Atomos Ninja Flame. Lights included 3x Arri 800w Tungstens, 2x Socanland LED banks to light the screen, and one 2000w Blonde to simulate sunlight. BIG thanks to the guys at HD Rentals in Perth for helping me out. http://www.hdrentals.tv/

Dexys Midnight Runners - Come On Eileen (Live Shaftesbury Theatre 1982),"If you have found this website I assume that you may already know something of Kevin Rowland and Dexys Midnight Runners but if you came here by mistake or if you have only recently converted to the new soul vision then here is a quick re-cap of the story so far....
It all began back in July 1978 when Kevin Rowland and Kevin Archer (later forced to change his name to Al after Rowland said ""there's only room for one Kevin in this band"") quit their second division Birmingham punk outfit, The Killjoys. While everyone else was busy starting the New Romantic movement Rowland and Archer looked to the 1960s soul icons for their inspiration and decided to form an eight piece soul band. The name came from the amphetamine of choice for the Northern Soul scene - dexedrine. Their image, fashioned by Rowland, was New York Italian docker chic ! Donkey jackets, woolly hats and polo neck jumpers. Very much like the early Robert De Niro film ""Mean Streets"" .The debut single ""Dance Stance"" (later re-named ""Burn It Down""), an attack on racism against the Irish, struggled into the UK charts at number 40. Trying to finance a band of eight was proving very difficult and it is alleged that Rowland instigated many shoplifting trips to supplement their income. The second single ""Geno"", a tribute to 60s soul singer Geno Washington, went to the top of the charts in 1980. Two months later the debut album ""Searching For The Young Soul Rebels"" was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Although this was only after the band stole the master tapes in order to re-negotiate a better contract. In May 1980 they went on a 44 date tour - the ""Straight To The Heart"" tour and in August followed it up with the ""Intense Emotions Tour"". Another Top 10 single, ""There There My Dear"" followed but then the release of the blatantly uncommercial ""Keep It Pt2"" preceded the spilt of Dexys mark 1. Rowland complained about losing control of the band and the band complained about his excessive control !! In 1981 only Kevin Rowland and Big Jim Paterson remained from the original line up. Most of the others went to form The Bureau or The Blue Ox Babes. Rowland recruited a new team including Seb Shelton from mod band Secret Affair on drums. After one more single for EMI, the excellent ""Plan B"" the band moved to Phonogram and along with that came a new image. A uniform of boxing boots, anoraks with hoods and pony tails. Two singles, ""Show Me"" and ""Liars A To E"", continued their chart success and a highly acclaimed live show ""The Projected Passion Revue"" culminated at the Old Vic Theatre in London.
By 1982 though, another change of line up and image had taken place. Rowland's right hand man, Big Jim Paterson, had left and the Celtic Soul Brother incarnation was launched in Newcastle at the BBC In Concert gig. (Rowland now admits that the idea for a combination of brass and strings had been influenced by a tape that Al Archer, now of The Blue Ox Babes, had lent him). ""Come On Eileen"" became the biggest selling UK single of 1982 and a US number one in 1983. The album ""Too-Ry-Ay"" and subsequent tour ""The Bridge"" received rave reviews.
Dexys disappeared for 18 months to work on the next album ""Don't Stand Me down"". When they returned they were down to a four piece and several session musicians. Another uniform came with the new album, this time a smart neat college preppie look. Many think that this is Rowland's greatest work but he insisted that there would be no singles. The album sold poorly and out of desperation the record company released ""This Is What She's Like"" as a single. It didn't help and the band fell apart. Although another single ""Because Of You""(theme to Brush Strokes) briefly charted.
In 1988 Rowland returned as a soloist with the weak country pop album ""The Wanderer"". However, many agree that the production let it down and that the songs were reasonably good.
Kevin Rowland spent the following years battling against depression, bankruptcy and cocaine addiction. Although, in 1993 he joined up with Big Jim again but despite a couple of TV performances nothing was ever officially released. 
In 1996, Creation Records signed Kevin Rowland and ""My Beauty"", an idiosyncratic covers album, was released in 1999. It received mixed reviews but sold very poorly (allegedly less that 500 copies). Perhaps because of the new image that went with it - dresses and suspenders !
2001, found Kevin doing reading recitals - from ""The Look"" a book about fashion and music by Paul Gorman. Kevin supplied a few pages to the book and read excerpts as well as performing a couple of songs live to backing tapes.
That just about brings us up to date. Keep an eye on my latest news page for any other updates.
As Jon Wilde said once in the Dexys fanzine ""Keep On Running"" ...YOU'D HAVE TO BE A HALF-WIT TO BET AGAINST A MAN OF KEV'S CALIBRE PULLING OFF A HUGE COMEBACK.""",2023-08-21T00:51:59Z,Cs4_LZl1OIs

Full Lyrics

I've been waiting for you
To come around and tell me the truth
About everything that you're going through
My girl, you've got nothing to lose

Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the gray

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

I've been dreaming 'bout us
Working hard and saving it up
We'll go and see the man on the moon
My girl, we've got nothing to lose

Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the gray

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head, and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

My girl, my girl
It takes one hard second to turn it around
It takes one hard second to turn it around

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head, and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

I've got time and I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town, silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl",2022-01-30T22:14:10Z,zb_whk63zdE

Full Lyrics

Me and Sam in the car, talking 'bout America
Heading to the wishing well, we've reached our last resort
I turned to him said: ""Man help me out
I fear I'm on an island in an ocean full of change
Can't bring myself to dive in to an ocean full of change

Am I losing touch?
Am I losing touch now?""

He said: ""Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to over thinking and
Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to second guessing""

Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
We're alright together, he-ey

Took it in turns to dream about the lottery
And what we might have done
If we had entered and had won
We're each convinced that nothing would have changed
But if this were the case
Why is it a conversation anyways?

Are we losing touch?
Are we losing touch now?

He said: ""Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to over thinking and
Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to second guessing""

Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
We're alright together, he-ey

Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy
Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy
Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy

Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
We're alright together
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
We're alright together, he-ey",2022-01-13T02:29:22Z,XP32nDUMYS8

Lyrics:

Homegrown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

We're south of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea diving 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

We got two in the front (hey)
Two in the back (hey)
Sailing along
And we don't look back (back, back)

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone, a someone, a someone, someone

Lyrics

We get it almost every night
When that moon gets so big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody's
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody's
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody's
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight",2021-11-16T00:40:53Z,qfxrQFMvP8o

Dancing In The Moonlight COVER,"My band mates helped me make this cover. David Derman on vocals, Oliver Amos on bass and keys, and myself on guitar and drums.

We recorded this during the height of lockdown, so David recorded his vocals at home on an iPhone 5, and Oli and I made use of what gear we had available to us to put this together. It was quite a challenge!

Hope you enjoy it!

Lyrics: 
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me and love another,
You'll regret it all some day

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
Please don't take my sunshine away

Lyrics:

What we're living in?
Lemme tell ya
Yeah, it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's gonna change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother can choose the color
Of her child, that's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do, but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures
That we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, wow
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad
As a man-made man
Oh, yeah, I know, yeah (take it to the dance floor)
I know I can't go on
Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in
Oh, oh, virtual insanity
Oh, this world
He's got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what is, yeah
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, oh
Futures made of, now, virtual insanity
Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
And now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Yes, we do, oh
now this life that we live in
(Virtual insanity) it's all going wrong
Out of the window (living in)
Do you know there is nothing worse than (virtual insanity)
a man-made man
(Virtual insanity) there's nothing worse than
(Living in) a foolish man
(Virtual insanity) hey!
Virtual insanity is what we're living in, yeah
Well... It's alright",2021-11-11T13:59:59Z,OeTFAiYbR9o

Lyrics:
Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, miss-spells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, misspells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

In hell I'll be in Good Company

=======================================

Comptine d'un autre été - l'après midi is a piece that appears on Yann Tiersen's soundtrack to the French movie Amelie which was released in 2001. The original is for solo piano only and is an extremely popular piece for amateur pianists here on YouTube to upload. In fact if you look real closely at the terms and conditions for YouTube it does say that all amateur pianists have to record and upload this track so make sure you're not breaking the rules.... All right, I may be making that bit up but it seems like the case :-D

The original solo piano version sounds great by itself and really doesn't need any embelishment but I also offer a reimagined version that sounds a little fuller and hopefully adds even more emotion to a beautiful piece.

1. Blue Swede - Hooked on a Feeling,"Guardians of the Galaxy - Awesome Mix Vol. 1 track 1

The 1:1 aspect ratio is deliberate and gives the same size when watching on your phone regardless if you hare holding it horizontal or vertical. Do you like the square video or do you prefer standard widescreen 16:9?

Blue Swede recorded B. J. Thomas' song in 1973, but based its rendition of the song on a 1971 version released by British pop eccentric Jonathan King, which created the ""ooga-chaka ooga-chaka"" introduction. Blue Swede released ""Hooked on a Feeling"" in Sweden in May 1973 and in the United States in February 1974. The song reached number-one in the U.S. for one week in April 1974 and stayed in the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 18 weeks. The track also topped charts in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands.",2016-05-09T11:36:59Z,NrI-UBIB8Jk

Lyrics:

Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living.

I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven.
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand
We'll travel south cross land
Put out the fire
And don't look past my shoulder.

The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together
Before we get much older.

Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland.
Teenage wasteland
Oh, yeah
Its only teenage wasteland
They're all wasted!
